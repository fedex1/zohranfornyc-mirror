First, it would renovate 500 public schools (over a quarter of the city’s total stock) with renewable energy—specifically rooftop solar—and HVAC upgrades to accelerate the city’s energy transition and improve learning conditions. Second, it would build 500 green schoolyards, transforming heat-absorbing asphalt into green space serving students and community residents. And third, it would transform 50 schools into resilience hubs, which serve as year-round community resources and where neighborhood residents can gather and receive aid and/or shelter during extreme weather events such as heat waves and flooding. Resilience hubs were first built in Baltimore and are a key feature of climate adaptation plans in more than 250 cities across the country. Local schools that residents know, trust, and often cherish are seen as ideal locations for these hubs.\n\n    These infrastructural projects are guided by two overarching principles. The first is the use of union labor. The Mamdani campaign estimates that the Green Schools plan will generate at least 15,000 union jobs. The second is combating environmental racism by, for instance, prioritizing out-of-date school facilities most often located in communities of color. By linking climate action to quality-of-life improvements for New York City’s marginalized communities, the Green Schools plan would combat the notion, perpetuated by utilities companies and others, that there is an inherent trade-off between meeting climate goals and affordability."}],y=[{key:"01",alt:"Our plan to make buses free will save NYC riders 36 million hours every year and generate $1.5 billion in economic benefits (2x the costs!)"},{key:"02",alt:'Without fare collection & with all-door boarding, trips will be faster.\n   NYC\'s buses are the slowest in the country, robbing New Yorkers of precious time for family, leisure and rest.\n   Free buses will shave 12% off the time of an average bus trip, adding up to 36 million hours for riders every year.\n   Source: "Eliminating NYC Transit Bus Fares: An Appraisal," Charles Komanoff, Nurture Nature Foundation, April 15, 2025'},{key:"03",alt:"1 in 5 New Yorkers struggle to afford the fare.\n    Free buses would create nearly $1.5 billion in benefits via faster, more reliable service and saved fare money.\n    That's more than double what it would cost the MTA in lost revenue, $630 million, which is less than 4% of hte MTA's budget.\n    Each dollar in support of free buses would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents."},{key:"04",alt:"Fast & free buses will also improve our safety & environment.
